Thanks for the feedback. I can definitely see how this feature would be helpful to our customers. Luckily, our development team is already on it, and we expect to release it next quarter.

Let me know, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other additional insights that you’d like me to pass on to our development team.

Thanks for the feedback. I can definitely see why you would be interested in that feature. Unfortunately, it’s not on our roadmap as of now.
Since our development resources are currently limited, we have decided to tackle features X and Y as a priority, as the majority of our customers have heavily requested them. These features will also be beneficial to you because of (…).
That being said, we’ll let you know if anything changes around this. Please do reach out if you have any other requests – we’re always here to listen.

          <textarea id="template6" style="display:none;">Hi [NAME],
Thanks for reaching out. I can definitely understand that it’s frustrating to lose a feature that you’ve come to rely on in your business. Unfortunately, we are not planning to bring it back any time soon.
The reason is that it was a complex feature to maintain. It wasn’t being used by the majority of our customers, which meant we were spending a lot of development time and resources on something that wasn’t making our product better for most users.
However, by making a decision to drop it, we’ve managed to allocate those resources into building (new features) that will be launched much sooner than we otherwise could have achieved.
I realize it’s not the answer you were hoping for, though. Some of our other customers have found that (alternative feature) is a fairly good substitute for that functionality. If you’d like to, I’d be happy to give you my best advice on how you can use it.
Sincerely,
